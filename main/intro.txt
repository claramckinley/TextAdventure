You are a weary traveler, alone in the eerie twilight of a desolate highway. Your radio has been your only company for hours and you havent passed a gas station for many many miles.

Your vehicle sputters, the needle on your gas gauge dipping perilously low. Knuckles white on the wheel, the next gentle curve through the trees quite suddenly reveals a dilapidated welcome sign: Welcome to ________. And down the way you see a gas station. 

You fill up and decide it is far too late and your eyes are far too blurred to continue your trek. You drive down the road a ways and come across a tired-looking hotel.

Bleary-eyed you stumble into the lobby, where a very thin man, the innkeeper, silently holds out a set of keys labeled room 428 and gestures with a long spidery arm toward a narrow staircase.

As though in a dream, you ascend to your room for the night.
