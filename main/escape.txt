You found all of the missing parts of your car!

You frantically replace the parts and scramble into the front seat. The engine roars to life and you slam your foot on the gas. Your wheels spin on the grass then finally find purchase.

You peel out of _____, your eyes wild as you stare in horror at the rearview mirror. In the reflection you can see the outline of an indescribable horror. You slam your eyelids shut as you zoom away.

It is weeks later. You still cannot get the image of that creature out of your mind, the image of the carvings and symbols burned into your corneas.

You sit at a folding table looking out the window you look out every day. The doctor passes and puts their hand on your shoulder asking how you have been feeling today. 

You don't answer.
